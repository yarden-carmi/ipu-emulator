"""Registry mechanics, and a generic conformance suite every kernel inherits.

The registry's whole value is that its answers match reality, so most of these
tests are consistency checks against the kernels themselves rather than
assertions about hardcoded strings. Crucially, the conformance tests are
written against *whatever is registered* -- a newly added kernel is verified
automatically, and a kernel whose ``supports`` over-claims fails here rather
than in a user's hands.

    conv1x1_fp32.asm -- pointwise (1x1) FP32 convolution, all output channels

    out[o, y, x] = bias[o] + SUM_ci W[o, ci] * in[ci, y, x]

    A 1x1 convolution has no spatial window, so each output element is a pure
    channel-space dot product and every lane of a 128-element tile reduces
    independently. That makes the whole kernel one accumulation loop over input
    channels, with no taps, no border and no mask.

    MEMORY (all XMEM operands are ROW numbers; one row = 128 elements = 512 B
    in wide-vector debug mode -- see issue #179):
      Input   CR2: channel-major planes. Channel ci occupies PLANE_STRIDE rows
                   at CR2 + ci*PLANE_STRIDE; spatial row y occupies NCT rows at
                   +y*NCT, one row per 128-column tile. A spatial row shorter
                   than NCT*128 pads with idle lanes -- addressing is
                   row-granular, so there is no tighter packing to exploit.
                   ONE GUARD PLANE follows the last real channel (see below).
      Weight  CR4: NGROUPS rows per output channel at CR4 + o*NGROUPS. Row g
                   holds W[o, g*128 : (g+1)*128], zero-padded in the last group.
      Bias    CR5: one row per output channel; bias[o] in element 0.
      Output  CR3: same plane layout as the input, COUT planes, written in
                   (o, y, tile) order by a single running row counter.

    BIAS AND ACCUMULATOR RESET IN ONE WORD:
      There is no RESET_ACC in this ISA, so the reset folds into an
      ACC.ADD.FIRST. Rather than peel the first channel's MAC out of both
      loops to carry it, the bias supplies it:

        MULT.EE lr_bias cr1 0 lr0 cr15 ; ACC.ADD.FIRST ;;

      broadcasts R1[0] (= bias[o]) x CR1 (= 1.0) and overwrites R_ACC with it.
      Every MAC in every group is then a uniform ACC.ADD -- no peel, no
      duplicated group body -- and because the word touches no input data it
      cannot manufacture a 0*inf NaN the way a multiply-by-zero reset would.
      This also removes the bias-as-an-all-ones-input-channel trick the older
      byte-addressed kernel used, so Cin' == Cin (no synthetic plane).

    SOFTWARE-PIPELINED CHANNEL LOOP:
      MULT.RC.* reads R_CYCLIC from the start-of-word SNAPSHOT while
      LDR_CYCLIC_MULT_REG's offset is read LIVE, so a load co-issued with the
      multiply that consumes it would be one channel too late. The body instead
      advances lr_addr and loads channel c+1 in the same word whose multiply
      consumes channel c from the snapshot:

        ADD lr_addr +PLANE ; ADD lr_widx +1 ; ADD lr_c +1 ;
        LDR_CYCLIC(lr_addr) ; MULT.RC.VE(snapshot) ; ACC.ADD ;;

      The final iteration therefore prefetches channel index Cin, whose data is
      never consumed but whose row must still be in bounds -- hence the ONE
      GUARD PLANE the harness reserves past the last real channel.

      lr_widx is seeded to -1 (not 0) because MULT.RC.VE's `src` operand is
      resolved LIVE inside the handler, so the same-word increment lands before
      the read. The -1 is never itself read; the LR add wraps 0xFFFFFFFF -> 0.

    EXACT CHANNEL GROUPS (no padding):
      One LDR_MULT_REG row holds 128 FP32 weights and a 1x1 kernel needs one
      weight per channel, so a group covers up to 128 channels. The group size
      is computed exactly as min(128, Cin - done), so a 129-channel input runs
      128 then 1. R_ACC is never reset between groups -- the accumulation
      simply continues, which is what makes an arbitrary Cin work.

    CR map (set by the harness; CR0/CR1 are READ-ONLY hardware constants):
      CR0  = 0  (zero source)          CR1  = 1  (-> 1.0 scalar; every +1)
      CR2  = INPUT_BASE   (rows)       CR3  = OUTPUT_BASE (rows)
      CR4  = WEIGHT_BASE  (rows)       CR5  = BIAS_BASE   (rows)
      CR6  = PLANE_STRIDE = H*NCT (rows, input and output alike)
      CR7  = NCT = ceil(W/128)  (rows per spatial row; column-tile bound)
      CR8  = H (spatial rows)          CR9  = CIN
      CR10 = COUT                      CR11 = NGROUPS = ceil(CIN/128)
                                             (also the weight-row advance per
                                              output channel)
      CR12 = 128 (group cap; also the Ra element index selecting R1[0] = bias)
      CR13, CR14 = free
      CR15 = dstructure (valid_elements = 128), named by MULT/ACTIVATE

    The group weight stride is one row, which is CR1 -- it needs no CR of its
    own. CR6 = CR8*CR7 is precomputed by the harness because the LR slot has no
    multiply.

    LR uses 3 sub-slots; ";;" ends a VLIW word, ";" separates sub-instructions.
    Slot order within a word is LR -> LOAD -> MULT -> ACC -> AAQ -> STORE ->
    COND, which is why the store's offset register is never incremented in the
    store's own word.
    r_cyclic loads use index 0 in wide mode (full 512 B load).

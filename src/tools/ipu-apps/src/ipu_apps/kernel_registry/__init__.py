"""Op-agnostic kernel registry: which app implements a given computation.

Kernels declare themselves where they live. An app package exports a module
level ``SPEC`` (a :class:`~ipu_apps.kernel_registry.spec.KernelSpec`) saying
what operation it implements and which shapes it handles; discovery walks the
app tree and collects them. Nothing central lists the kernels, so adding one is
purely additive.

Query it at whichever level suits the caller::

    from ipu_apps.kernel_registry import resolve, lookup_layer

    # framework-native: a layer plus the shape it will see
    lookup_layer(nn.Softmax(dim=1), input_shape=(32, 300))

    # framework-free
    resolve("softmax", dim=1, shape=(32, 300))

Both return a :class:`~ipu_apps.kernel_registry.spec.Verdict` carrying the app
class, its constructor kwargs, the reasoning, and any caveats that still apply.

The design rules worth knowing before adding a kernel:

* a kernel's ``supports`` is the **only** statement of its domain -- app
  constructors delegate their guards to it rather than restating bounds;
* overlapping claims are resolved by declared ``cost``, never discovery order;
* coverage reports are **generated** by probing kernels, never hand-written;
* shapes travel as a role-keyed bundle (input/weight/bias/output), so
  multi-tensor operations fit without changing the query envelope.

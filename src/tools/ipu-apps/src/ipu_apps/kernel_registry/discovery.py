"""Finding every kernel that has declared itself, at any nesting depth.

Kernels are not listed anywhere central. Discovery walks the ``ipu_apps``
package tree and collects every module-level ``SPEC`` (or ``SPECS`` for a
module declaring several). Adding a kernel is then purely additive: no
registration list to edit, no import to remember.

Two properties this has to hold:

* **Arbitrary depth.** ``softmax`` nests kernels one level down, but the
  convolution family nests them three (``convolutions_universal/conv/
  conv_universal/``). Recursion is not optional.
* **Tolerance of broken or half-present packages.** A working tree can easily
  contain directories that are not importable -- stale ``__pycache__`` shells
  left behind by a branch switch, a kernel mid-authoring, an optional
  dependency that is not installed. Discovery records those as
  :class:`SkippedModule` and carries on. A registry that raises on import of an
  unrelated half-finished app would be worse than useless in exactly the
  situation people need it.

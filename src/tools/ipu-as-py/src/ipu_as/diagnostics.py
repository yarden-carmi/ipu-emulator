"""Report assembly errors as positioned diagnostics, for editor squiggles.

A TextMate grammar assigns scopes to spans; it has no way to say "this is
wrong", and no notion of what the grammar expects next. Validity is not a
lexical property — whether a comma is legal depends on the parser's state, not
on the characters. So the only thing that can answer "is this valid" is the
parser itself, which is what this module runs.

Three stages are checked, in the order the assembler runs them, stopping at the
first failure (a template that will not render cannot be parsed, and a program
that will not parse cannot be encoded):

1. Jinja rendering   -> TemplateSyntaxError
2. Parsing           -> lark.exceptions.LarkError
3. Encoding          -> ValueError from CompoundInst

Positions are 0-based, matching LSP and the VS Code API.

"""ISA alias specification — declarative table of missing-instruction stand-ins.

The ISA has no vector move, add, subtract, broadcast or gather, and every
``ACC.*``/``AGG.*`` op consumes ``MULT_RES``. There is therefore no path into the
accumulator that avoids the multiplier, so kernels fake those operations with a
multiply against a hardwired 1.0. Those cycles bill as "MULT active" while
retiring zero MACs, which is why ``mult%`` is not MAC utilization.

This table declares those idioms so the emulator can count them. It holds **no
instruction metadata** — only references into ``INSTRUCTION_SPEC``, checked by
``validate_isa_alias_spec()`` at import. See ``docs/content/isa-alias-catalogue.md``
for what each alias stands in for and the sequence that implements it.

Structure:

    ISA_ALIAS_SPEC = {
        "<alias id>": {
            "missing_op": "MOV.RC",   # what the ISA should have
            "summary":    "...",      # one line, for humans reading the table
            "matches": [
                {"slot": "mult", "instruction": "MULT.RC.VE", "where": [...]},
                ...
            ],
        },
    }

Constraint vocabulary for ``where`` (a closed set — extend deliberately):

    {"operand": "src", "scalar_is": 1}
        That operand supplies a constant 1.0 from a CR. Dtype-aware: the
        emulator compares against the dtype's own encoding of 1.0. Only 1 is
        expressible — see ``_SCALAR_VALUES``. An operand naming an LR selects
        an element of R0/R1, which is *data*, and never matches: a quantized
        weight that happens to equal 1 is a real MAC, not a pass-through.

    {"operand": "mask_offset", "immediate_ne": 0}
        Raw immediate field differs from the literal. Only operands declared
        as MultMaskOffsetImmediate are supported in v1; register operands are
        rejected, even when they have no automatic read.

    {"vector_ones": True}
        A MULT.RC.VV or MULT.RC.VE vector operand comes from an explicitly
        declared ONES load. Provenance follows register snapshots and is
        revoked on overwrites; operand bytes must still encode numeric one.

    {"masked_window": True}
        A nonzero mask slot, or a nonempty mask-zero window narrower than the
        instruction's declared destination span. A mask matching valid_elements
        is ordinary padding, not a routing window.

    {"co_slot": "acc", "instruction_in": ("ACC.ADD",)}
        Another slot **in the same bundle** issues one of these. This is what
        separates the aliases: A1/A2/A3/A4/A6 all use an identical
        ``MULT.RC.VE`` with a 1.0 scalar, and only the co-issued acc op says
        which missing operation is being emulated.

    {"hardware_only": True}
        The instruction's *slot* is flagged ``"hardware": False`` in
        ``SLOT_METADATA`` — simulation-only, no silicon encoding. Matches
        unconditionally; no runtime value is read.

Every match must carry exactly one of ``scalar_is``, ``vector_ones`` or
``hardware_only``: these are the ways the emulator can decide a match, and
the validator rejects anything else so a new entry cannot silently be treated
as an identity test it never asked for.
Scalar constraints must name the instruction's supported multiplicand. A match
can have at most one immediate constraint and one co-slot constraint, matching
the compiled representation. ``hardware_only`` must stand alone.

**Order matters: first match wins.** Entries are ordered most-specific first so
that each identity multiply is attributed to exactly one alias, which makes the
per-alias hit counts a partition of ``mult_identity_cycles`` rather than
overlapping tallies.
